Top Trackify

With the release of Spotify Wrapped 2024, I heard rumors that Spotify wasn't displaying our real top tracks and artists.
So, I decided to create an app that would use the data straight from the source, the Spotify API. 
In this project I used OAuth 2.0 to receive tokens and codes from Spotify and then used those tokens to access my personal data, straight from the Spotify database.
I originally was going to use Spotipy, which is a library for handling with Spotify OAuth, but decided to do everything without it, as it would further my understanding of API's and OAuth.


The rumors appear to be true; my top artists and tracks for the past year were different than the ones Spotify displayed in my 2024 Spotify Wrapped.
